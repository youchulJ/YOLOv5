# YOLOv5 Object Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of an object detection model using YOLOv5. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system, and version 5 (YOLOv5) introduces improvements in accuracy and speed.

## Features

- **YOLOv5 Architecture:** Utilizes the YOLOv5 neural network for efficient and accurate object detection.

- **Customizable Configurations:** Easily configure and train the model for different datasets and tasks.

- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision) and FPS (Frames Per Second).

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
